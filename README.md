## 🚀 What I Worked on  
- **HouseVal**: Predict house prices like a psychic—except I use data and Python.  
- **Sign Language Detection**: Teaching machines to understand hand gestures better than I do.  
- **Earthquake Prediction**: Trying to outsmart nature with ML (wish me luck).  
- **Image Classification**: Turning pixels into insights.
